BlanQA
======

BlanQA is an OpenQA-based question answering pipeline meant for practical
end-user usage in simple applications.  Its goals are practicality, clean
design and maximum simplicity.

BlanQA is developed as part of the Brmson platform and many of its components
are based on the work of the good scientists at CMU (e.g. the helloqa prototype
branch and the Ephyra project).  Compared to their work, we shift our focus
from systematic evaluation of experiments to interactive usage.

In its initial version, it can answer English questions about a small corpus
of English text.
