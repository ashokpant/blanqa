BlanQA
======

BlanQA is an OpenQA-based question answering pipeline meant for practical
end-user usage in simple applications.  It is developed as part of the
Brmson platform and many of its components are based on the work of the
good scientists at CMU (e.g. the helloqa prototype branch and the Ephyra
project).

In its initial version, it can answer English questions about a small corpus
of English text.
